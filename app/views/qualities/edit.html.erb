  <em>Personal attributes: those aspects of our personalities and natural abilities that we find so difficult to change - 
      although sometimes training or mentoring can make a difference over time.  If people just don't have the right attributes for a 
      job, it's unlikely they'll make a success of it ... even if they have the required knowledge and skills.
