Dear <%= @reviewer.name %>
<br /><br />
  The records show me that a performance review is overdue for <%= @reviewee.name %>, and I'd like
  to ask for your help in conducting the review.
  <br /><br />
  When you open your copy of HYGWIT, you'll see that you have a new review request. Just follow the links and instructions
  there.
  <br /><br />
  The review is due to be completed by <%= (@review.created_at + 14.days).strftime("%a %b %d, %Y") %>.  If that's a problem, or you can't
  do the review for some other reason, please let us know as soon as possible via the <i>Respond</i> link on the <i>Respond 
  to a review request</i> page, so that other arrangements can be made.
  <br /><br />
  Thanks for your help.
  <br /><br />
  <%= @user.name %>
