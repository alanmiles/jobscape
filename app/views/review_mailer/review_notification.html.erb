Dear <%= @reviewee.name %>
<br /><br />
  The records show me that it's time for a colleague to review your performance - you've probably noticed
  a reminder about it on your HYGWIT menu page recently.
  <br /><br />
  Regular colleague reviews - every 6 months or so - are important. You've already been doing your self-appraisals
  of course, but working on a review with someone else will tell you how others perceive your achievements.  If your
  reviewer is a senior colleague or your manager, it also gives you a good opportunity to get a second opinion about
  steps you'd like to take to develop your own skills or performance.  It'd be a good time too to put forward any
  suggestions about changing the Achievement Plan - setting the targets higher, perhaps.
  <br /><br />
  To get you started, I've set up a new review session, as you'll see when you next log in to HYGWIT.  I'm suggesting
  that your reviewer should be <%= @reviewer.name %>, who's also been notified.
  <br /><br />
  If you have any questions or problems with this, just let me know.
  <br /><br />
  Best wishes
  <br /><br />
