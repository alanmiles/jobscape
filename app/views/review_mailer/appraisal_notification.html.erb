Dear <%= @reviewee.name %>
<br /><br />
  The records show me that it's time for you to do a self-appraisal - you've probably noticed
  a reminder on your HYGWIT menu page recently.
  <br /><br />
  Regular self-appraisal is important - every 2-3 months, if you haven't had a colleague review in the same
  period. It'll ensure that you're still focused on the key job and business objectives.  It'll also get 
  you well prepared for your next colleague review - so there won't be any nasty surprises.
  <br /><br />
  To get you started, I've set up a new self-appraisal session, as you'll see when you next log in to HYGWIT.
  <br /><br />
  If you have any questions or problems with this, just let me know.
  <br /><br />
  Best wishes
  <br /><br />
