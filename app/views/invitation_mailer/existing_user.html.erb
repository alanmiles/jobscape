Dear <%= @invitation.name %>
<br /><br />
  I'm inviting you to start using a new HYGWIT account for your job at <strong><%= @business.name %></strong>.
  <br /><br />
  You don't need to do anything - just log in to your HYGWIT account as usual, and you'll see that you now
  have an option to access your records at <%= @business.name %>.
  <br /><br />
  <% if @job.plan.complete? %>
    Your job title is <%= @job.job_title %>, and you'll see that the Achievement Plan has been written.  Take a
    look at it, discuss it with other people in your team, and let me know if anything needs to be added, 
    removed, or updated. 
  <% else %>
    Your job title is <%= @job.job_title %>, and you'll see that the Achievement Plan is still incomplete.  So
    let's shape it together - you, your colleagues and manager, and me.  Working on an A-Plan is a great way
    to understand what the business expects from you, and it'll get you started on the path towards a successful
    and fulfilling career.
  <% end %>
  <br /></br />
  I'm looking forward to working with you.
  <br /><br />
  <%= @sender.name %>
