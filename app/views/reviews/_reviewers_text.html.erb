    In the old-style appraisal, managers gave their opinions on employee performance.  But a HYGWIT review
    is different.  It's not about opinions, but facts: did you achieve the A-Plan responsibility and attribute
    targets?  With clearly-defined measurements, you can review your own performance, and you should get the same 
    results as you would from an external reviewer.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to ask your boss or someone 
    senior to do a review as well.  Why?  Because it's useful to have a second opinion as you work out how you can 
    best improve the results next time.
