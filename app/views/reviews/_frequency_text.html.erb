    Many businesses review performance annually.  But a year is much too long to wait if targets aren't 
    being hit. The damage may have been done long ago. HYGWIT makes reviews easy - there's no paperwork and 
    it just takes a minute to set up.  So make it a habit to review your own performance and achievements 
    every 2-3 months - and then ask your manager or a senior colleague to review roughly every 6 months, or more frequently if 
    you're new in the job or struggling to meet targets.
