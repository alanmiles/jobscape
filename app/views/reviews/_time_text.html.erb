    With the A-Plan in place, there's no preparation: if it's a colleague review, you'll just need
    to make arrangements with your reviewer.  For a first-timer, evaluating performance might take around 
    20 minutes, but with practice you'll be doing it in half the time.  Remember though that evaluation is 
    just the starting-point.  In a good review session, you'll spend just as long - or longer - analyzing 
    the results and planning the next few weeks' work.  If you're hitting the targets easily, is it time 
    to set new goals and aim higher? Are there new responsibilities you need to add to the A-Plan or old ones
    you need to remove?  And how will you fix the areas where you're failing?
