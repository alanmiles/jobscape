          Your A-Plan is written and ready to use, and at the moment it's locked - you can't change it.<br /><br />
        
          But if you notice that something needs to change - perhaps your job focus has changed, or you feel that the 
          targets are unachievable or too easy - then speak to your manager about it, and if you both agree, ask one of
          your HYGWIT administrators to change the A-Plan. You may then be asked to update the A-Plan yourself, subject
          to approval.<br /><br />
        
          Businesses and jobs change all the time - so don't be afraid to ask for a change, particularly if you feel the 
          job isn't challenging enough and you could do more for the business.  But if you share your job-title with other 
          colleagues, ask them how they feel before you talk to your boss.  If you're finding everything easy but they're
          not, ask yourself first whether you could do more to help the rest of the team.

          Your A-Plan isn't ready yet, and it's been locked by your HYGWIT administrator - perhaps it's being prepared now.
          Talk to your administrator and find out when it'll be ready.

          Your A-Plan appears to be ready to use, but it remains open for further editing and updates.  Perhaps you're
          planning to add more responsibilities or goals.  Normally, when everyone agrees that the Plan's complete, 
          your HYGWIT administrator will lock it, to make sure that reviews are consistent.  So if you're sure there's
          nothing more to add and the Plan's been approved by your boss, have a word with your administrator.<br /><br />
         
          Locking the A-Plan doesn't mean it will stay fixed for ever.  Most jobs change over time, and you'll probably
          need to update it if you and your boss agree that you could set more ambitious targets, or if an aspect of
          the job changes.  When that happens, all you need to do is speak to the administrator again ... unlocking
          the Plan is straightforward.
        
        <% else %>
          Your A-Plan isn't complete yet.  Who better to write it than you? ... together with any colleagues who share
          your job-title.  After all, you're supposed to know it best!  Discuss the plan with colleagues and your boss, making
          sure you all agree with the objectives.  Check too that your plan is well-aligned to the business strategy.
          <br /><br />
          You may find that discussion of the A-Plan will also lead to new discoveries: identification of a 
          problem previously unnoticed, or suggestions for a more effective or efficient approach.<br /><br />
        
          When you've finished, ask your direct manager to check it.  It will then pass to your HYGWIT Administrator who'll
          confirm that everything's been done properly, and then probably lock it until it needs to be updated again.

      Businesses and jobs change all the time. If the business circumstances or the scope of your job change,
      don't forget to update the A-Plan.  If you're finding that you're achieving your targets easily (and your
      colleagues agree that you're doing well, it's probably time to think about setting more difficult targets.  
      Remember that the whole point of HYGWIT is continuous improvement.  As your achievements begin to stack up, 
      people will start to think of you as a star.<br /><br />
      
      Whenever you're thinking about an update, discuss it with your boss too, just making sure that your thinking is
      aligned and that what you're planning fits with the boss's plan for the team.  You may find that discussion of the 
      A-Plan with colleagues will also lead to new discoveries: identification of a problem previously unnoticed, or 
      suggestions for a more effective or efficient approach.

      It depends on the status of your business.<br /><br />
    
      If you're building a new business, defining the business strategy and then writing A-Plans for the first jobs will give
      your plans shape and certainty from the outset.<br /><br />
    
      In an existing business, when managers suggest that new jobs should be created, get them to make their case by writing 
      the A-Plan. First, this will make sure that they've thought through the job properly.  Secondly, the job-score ( - the sum of 
      the top 10 responsibility scores) will help you to decide the appropriate salary: look for other jobs with similar scores.
      <br /><br />
    
      If the business is established but you're just beginning with HYGWIT, ask your employees to write their own A-Plans and then
      get their managers to approve them.  This approach has many advantages.  First, it's obviously much faster than asking someone
      in HR to write all the A-Plans.  Secondly, it'll show you how well people understand their jobs.  Third, it'll make sure that
      employees and their managers have their objectives aligned. (Make sure as well that job-targets are not in conflict with 
      corporate objectives.)  You may also find that discussion of the A-Plan will lead to new discoveries: identification of a 
      problem previously unnoticed, or suggestions for a more effective or efficient approach.  Finally, we've found that
      asking employees to get involved in discussing their own A-Plans gives them a sense of empowerment and increases motivation.
      <br /><br />
    
      When everyone agrees that the A-Plan is complete, the HYGWIT administrator normally locks it.  But that doesn't mean the
      plan is fixed forever - in fact you should expect it to change.  When?  The business circumstances or the scope of the job
      may change. Capable and hard-working employees may be struggling to meet the targets.  Or they may be hitting the targets too
      easily and feel they can offer more.  Whenever this happens, unlock the A-Plan and encourage the jobholder(s) to update it;
      get the manager's approval for any changes, and check yourself that the Plan is still in line with the business strategy.
