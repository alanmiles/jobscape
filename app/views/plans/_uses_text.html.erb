    There's an important difference between a job description and an achievement plan.  Job descriptions usually just describe
    the activities an employee will be involved in, and they tend to be filed away until someone has cause for complaint
     - <i>'It's not in the job description!'</i>.  But an achievement plan includes the targets we need to hit on a daily, weekly,
    monthly basis, and they're therefore used much more often, helping people to grow in their jobs and to contribute 
    more.  Achievement is good for the business and good for the employee.<br /><br />
    
    If you're new in the job, your A-Plan shows you exactly what you have to do to impress your boss, and set
    you out on the right track.<br /><br />
    
    The A-Plan is also the basis for HYGWIT performance reviews.  We can say goodbye to the annual appraisal, dreaded by managers
    because of all the preparation involved and by employees who were never sure what they were going to be hit with.  With HYGWIT,
    reviews can be set up instantly, and it's absolutely clear what will be reviewed - whether the A-Plan targets have 
    been achieved or not. And we've added objectivity: in the old-style appraisal, we tended to ask managers for their opinions, 
    but in a HYGWIT review we ask them to stick with the facts.<br /><br />
    
    We recommend that you review your own performance every 2-3 months.  Are you achieving your goals?  If not, what needs to 
    change?  Do you need more training or more assistance? Is someone or something preventing you from succeeding?  If so, 
    how can you fix it?  Or if you're achieving everything comfortably, should the targets be set higher?  Could you be 
    contributing more?<br /><br />
    
    Then, at least every 6 months (more often if you feel you're struggling), get someone else to review your performance 
    - your boss or a senior colleague. If you've been honest with your self-reviews, there should be no surprises. 
    But the importance of the external review is the discussion that follows. How does your colleague think you should tackle 
    any problems or achieve more?<br /><br />

      You have an Individual HYGWIT account.  If you ever decide to sign up for a Business account, using HYGWIT across the
      whole business, the A-Plan has several other uses as well. The job-score ( - the sum of the top 10 responsibility scores) 
      helps to determine the appropriate salary for a new job: we look for other jobs with similar scores.

    Managers also use the A-Plan for recruitment and internal promotions.  The summary can be used - or easily adapted - 
    for recruitment advertisements. The key responsibilities, attributes and hiring requirements appear in the handy HYGWIT interview 
    scoresheets, making it easy to identify the internal or external candidates best suited to a vacant job.
