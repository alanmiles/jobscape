      An Achievement Plan is an enhanced job description - with clearly defined targets.<br /><br />
    
      First, a 3-paragraph summary includes a job outline, the key employee requirements, and why
      the job is important to the business.<br /><br />
    
      Next, 10 - 20 key responsibilities are listed, each with 1-3 measurable goals. Well-written goals 
      eliminate uncertainty: jobholders have either achieved their targets, or they haven't.
      <br /><br />
    
      Responsibilities also have a rating with a maximum score of 100, based on how much they
      contribute to company profitability, customer or employee satisfaction, or process improvement.
      The higher the rating, the more important it is to achieve the goals.<br /><br />  
    
      The A-Plan also defines 10 personality attributes that will contribute to success: 
      each attribute has five descriptors, from A to E (Outstanding to Poor).  The ideal employee will be rated
      at A or B, certainly for the attributes at the top of the list, which are the most important. <br /><br /> 
    
      And finally, the A-Plan lists the key requirements - qualifications, experience, background - 
      when someone new is hired for the job.

        As you write or update your A-Plan, it's important to discuss it with your boss.  You work in an organization
        and it's important to make sure that you're playing as part of the team.  Check that your view of what's 
        important is the same as your boss's view ... or there'll be trouble later!
