    You've completed half the job - looking back and reviewing recent performance.
    Now it's time to look forward. Do the questions in this review seem to fit the job - 
    or does the Achievement Plan need to change?  If everything's being achieved, should the
    standards be raised?  Or if there are problem areas, what do you recommend?

           If you haven't completed your review, but you want to save your changes to continue later, just click

           <%= (@review.created_at + 14.days).strftime("%a %b %d, %Y") %>.  If you haven't completed by then, the review
           will be automatically deleted.
