     You need to add 2-3 references, preferably one from someone senior (a former manager, 
     or if you're just starting your career, a teacher), a colleague or classmate, and perhaps
     a friend.
     <br /><br />
     When you decide to make your Self-Portrait public, an email will automatically be sent to
     your references, asking them to verify that the picture you've created shows the real you - so 
     you'd better make sure it does!
     <br /><br />
     You'll see on your profile whether they've responded - but not what they've said of course! If 
     they haven't responded, ask them to check their email inbox (check the spam filter, just in case), 
     and tell them it'll only take a couple of minutes of their time.
     <br /><br />
     If that doesn't work, delete the record and create it again ... or get yourself another reference.
