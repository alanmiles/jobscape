Dear <%= @user.name %>
<br /><br />

Thank you for suggesting the addition of '<%= @quality.quality %>' to the list of Personal Attributes in JobScape.
<br /><br />
We've checked the attributes and the PAMs and we're pleased to tell you that you'll now find your suggestion in the official
list of approved attributes.<br /><br />
You may notice modifications.  If so it'll be so that the definitions can be used by the whole community of JobScape users.<br /><br />
With best wishes<br /><br />
The JobScape Team
