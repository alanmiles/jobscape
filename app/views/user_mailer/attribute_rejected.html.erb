<p>Dear <%= @user.name %></p>

<p>Thank you for suggesting the addition of '<%= @quality.quality %>' to the list of Personal Attributes in JobScape.</p>

<p>We've checked the attributes and the PAMs and we regret that we cannot add your suggestion to the official
list of approved attributes.  We'll be mailing you shortly to explain why.</p>
<p>Despite this, we hope you're finding JobScape useful.</p>
<p>With best wishes</p>
The JobScape Team
