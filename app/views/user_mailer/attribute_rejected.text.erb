Dear <%= @user.name %>
<br /><br />
Thank you for suggesting the addition of '<%= @quality.quality %>' to the list of Personal Attributes in JobScape.
<br /><br />
We've checked the attributes and the PAMs and we regret that we cannot add your suggestion to the official
list of approved attributes.  We'll be mailing you shortly to explain why.<br /><br />
Despite this, we hope you're finding JobScape useful.<br /><br />
With best wishes<br /><br />
The JobScape Team
